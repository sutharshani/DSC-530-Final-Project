# Exploratory Data Analysis - 120 years of Olympic history
Exploratory Data Analysis of 120 years of Olympic history

In this project I did some exploratory analysis to answer certain questions like:
* After certain age as the athletes get older their chances of winning medals in Olympic decreases.
* Young athlete wins more modals as compared to older athlete.

I will be doing EDA on this dataset using Python to answer this question.

## Introduction
EDA is one of the critical process that we need to perform in our initial investigation to get good understanding 
about the dataset. In the process, we discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypothesis and test assumption with the 
help of summary statistics and graphical representations. \
In this project I performed below analysis:
* Histogram 
* Scatter Plot, Bar Chart
* Statistical Summary
* Probability mass function (PMF)
* Cumulative distribution function (CDF)
* Probability Density Function (PDF) 
* Normal Distribution

## Data Background

This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. 
Note that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such 
that Winter Games occur on a four-year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. \
The file athlete_events.csv contains 271116 rows and 15 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing
in an individual Olympic event (athlete-events). This data describes every athlete from Sex, Age, Height and Weight, 
as well as certain characteristics that comes from the performance of every athlete such as Medal.

The columns are:
1.	ID - Unique number for each athlete
1.	Name - Athlete's name
1.	Sex - M or F
1.	Age – Integer
1.	Height - In centimeters
1.	Weight - In kilograms
1.	Team - Team name
1.	NOC - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code
1.	Games - Year and season
1.	Year – Integer
1.	Season - Summer or Winter
1.	City - Host city
1.	Sport – Sport
1.	Event – Event
1.	Medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze, or NA

## Acknowledgement
I got to learn a lot of things about exploratory data analysis. In this term I got to learn how we can use statistical
methods for EDA. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main 
characteristics, often with visual methods. \
